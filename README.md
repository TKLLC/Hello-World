# Hello-World
My first respositoryâ€”wish me luck!

I worked as a Associate Creative Director / Art for many years. Now I manage social media sites including Web sites for my husband's business and other clients.

For the past few months, I've began using Bootstrap framework, some javascript and attempting to learn PHP with Ajax. Currently, my main focus is to understand how to use FormValidation.io on a registration form. I'm writing because I'm stumped. I've invested $50 to downloaded the js & css files.Tried put it together afer reviewing their samples. I've checked the code for possible errors. I've tried using the code samples. It doesn't work. I know there's something I don't understand that others would know to do. But what is it?
